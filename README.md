## Description:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze NEO data and build machine learning classifiers to predict whether an asteroid is hazardous based on its physical and orbital characteristics like the estimated size, velocity, distance, and magnitude of asteroids.

## Attributes:
1. est_diameter_min (Minimum Estimated Diameter in Kilometres)
1. est_diameter_max (Maximum Estimated Diameter in Kilometres)
1. relative_velocity (Velocity Relative to Earth)
1. miss_distance (Distance in Kilometres missed)
1. absolute_magnitude (Describes intrinsic luminosity)
## Organize:
EDA, classifier, web app
